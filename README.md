===============

Library of tools and examples for use when creating custom tools for Zim - Desktop Wiki (http://zim-wiki.org/)

These are mostly based on my personal needs, workflow and organization and I use them to speed-up my script creation process.
It can also be interesting to find examples and ideas for other uses.

This depends on Zim's own modules.
